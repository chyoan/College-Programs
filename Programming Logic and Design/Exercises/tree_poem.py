\t\t\t\b\b\b\b\bThink\n
\t\tThat I shall\n
\t\t\b\bNever see a poem\n
\t\t\b\b\bAs lovely as a tree,\n
\t\t\b\b\b\b\bA tree whose hungry mouth\n
\tIs pressed against the earth\'s\n
\t\bSweet flowing breast, a tree that\n
\t\b\bLooks at God all day, and lifts its\n
\t\b\b\b\bLeafy arms to pray. A tree that may in\n
\t\b\b\b\b\bSummer wear, a nest of robin in her hair;\n
Upon whose bosom snow has lain; who intimately\n
\t\t\bLives with rain.\n
\t\t\b\bPoems are made by\n
\t\tFools like Me\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bBut\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bOnly\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bGod\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bCan\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bMake\n
\t\t\t\b\bA\n
\t\t\t\b\b\bTree\n
\t\t\t\b\b\b\b\b\b\bJOYCE KILMER''')
