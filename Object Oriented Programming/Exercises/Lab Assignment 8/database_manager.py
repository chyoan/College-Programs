# Create a file named database_manager.py which contains the following class:
# â€¢ A class called MovieHouseDatabaseManager which has a single attribute called database_file of type String and has the following function:
# o a constructor that has a parameter of type String called database_file.
# o a function named get_connection. 
# This function should allow the app to connect to the database using the 3 attributes. 
# This function should be used throughout the class to connect to the database.
# o a function named register_movie which has a parameter of title, genre andcost. 
# This function will save the values to the movie table in their corresponding columns. 
# If the student was saved successfully, this function should return true. Otherwise, return false.
# o a function named remove_movie which has a parametor of id. 
# This method will update the is_deleted column of the movie with the same id as the parameter to true.
# o a function named retrieve_movies which has a parameter of genres, which is a List of strings. 
# This function will retrieve all movies that has genres found in the genres parameter. 
# If the array is empty, this function will instead retrieve all movies. This will return a list of Movie.
# o a function named retrieve_rooms. This function will retrieve all rooms from the database. 
# This will return a list of Movie.
# o a function named retrieve_recor dwhich has a parameter of room_id. 
# This function will retrieve the latest record of that room that is not yet finished. 
# If there are no records found, this will return an emptyRecordobject. 
# This function will also retrieve all movies associated with that record.
# o a function named check_in which has a parameter of room_id and movies, which is a List of Movie objects. 
# This function will create a room_record for with the parameters as its values. 
# This will also create a room_movie_record for each movie in the movies list. 
# This function will return true if the record was successfully created. Otherwise, return false.
# o a function named check_out which has a parameter of id. 
# This function will update the is_finished column of the record with the same id as the parameter. 
# This function will return true if the record was successfully updated. Otherwise, return false.
